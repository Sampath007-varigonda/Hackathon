## ⚠️ Important:

I cannot actually deploy your app because:
- I don't have access to your GitHub account
- I don't have access to hosting platforms
- Deployment requires your authentication

But I've prepared **everything** you need! Just follow `START_HERE.md` and you'll have a live app in ~10 minutes.

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck:

1. Check `START_HERE.md` for detailed steps
2. Check Railway/Render documentation
3. Ask me specific questions about any step

**Your code is 100% ready - just needs to be pushed and deployed!** 🚀
